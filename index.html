            <p style="color:blue;"> I was born in the historic city of Philadelphia to two immigrant parents from the small country of Tunisia. Here's a picture of the beautiful country and a Tunisia travel guide from which it was derived!</p>

I also had the priveledge of being the President this past year! Here's a link to our website and an image from one of our events! </p>
